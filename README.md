The initial source code has been written by Felix Niessen, Flyduino

The android port, including changes in the original source code has been made with written permission from Flyduino.

Release notes:

v1.0.1

This version loggs the maximum rates of the gyro and displays them underneath the graphs in the Data Output section. 
Therefor the FC needs to be twirled around all axis at the USB plug. Ideally the max values should be around 2000. 
If its much lower than that you either need to work on your "twirling technique" or you might have a bad gyro.
